# How to Prepare for a Leaderless Group Discussion (LGD)
 
A leaderless group discussion (LGD) is a type of assessment method that evaluates your interpersonal skills, problem-solving abilities, and leadership potential. It involves a group of candidates who are given a topic or a case to discuss without a designated leader or moderator. The goal is to reach a consensus or a solution within a limited time.

LGDs are often used by employers, universities, or scholarship providers to select candidates who can work well in teams, communicate effectively, and demonstrate initiative and creativity. LGDs can be challenging and stressful, especially if you are not familiar with the format or the topic. Therefore, it is important to prepare well for an LGD and know what to expect.
 
Here are some tips on how to prepare for a leaderless group discussion:
 
- **Research the topic or the case.** Before the LGD, you may be given some information about the topic or the case that you will discuss. You should research the background, facts, pros and cons, and possible solutions of the issue. You can use online sources such as [^1^] or [^2^] to find examples of LGD cases and topics. You should also be aware of current events and general knowledge that may be relevant to the discussion.
- **Practice your communication skills.** During the LGD, you will need to express your opinions clearly, listen actively, ask questions, and persuade others. You should practice your communication skills by participating in mock LGDs with your friends or colleagues. You can also watch videos of LGDs online or read transcripts of LGD sessions to learn from other candidates' strategies and mistakes.
- **Be confident and assertive.** In an LGD, you should show your leadership potential by taking initiative, contributing ideas, and facilitating the discussion. You should not be passive or silent, but neither should you be aggressive or dominant. You should balance your confidence and assertiveness with respect and cooperation. You should acknowledge other candidates' points of view, build on their ideas, and avoid conflicts or arguments.
- **Be flexible and creative.** In an LGD, you may encounter different opinions, perspectives, and challenges from other candidates or from the case itself. You should be flexible and creative in adapting to changing situations and finding solutions. You should not be rigid or stubborn in sticking to your own ideas or assumptions. You should be open-minded and willing to compromise or change your stance if necessary.

By following these tips, you can prepare for a leaderless group discussion and increase your chances of success. Remember that an LGD is not only a test of your knowledge or intelligence, but also of your personality and character. Therefore, you should be yourself and show your best qualities during the discussion.
  
Another tip on how to prepare for a leaderless group discussion is to know how to end it. An LGD usually has a time limit, and you should be aware of how much time you have left. You should also have a clear goal or outcome for the discussion, such as a decision, a recommendation, or a summary.
 
As the end of the LGD approaches, you should try to wrap up the discussion by summarizing the main points, highlighting the areas of agreement and disagreement, and proposing a solution or a conclusion. You should also thank the other candidates for their participation and ask for their feedback or approval.
 
Sometimes, an LGD may require one person to be chosen as the leader to represent the group and report the findings. This can be done by voting, volunteering, or nominating. You should be prepared to take on this role if you are selected or if no one else steps up. You should also be respectful and supportive of whoever is chosen as the leader and help them deliver a clear and concise report.
